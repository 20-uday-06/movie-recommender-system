# Movie Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering

This project implements a movie recommender system using content-based filtering. The system suggests movies based on the features of movies you have already watched and liked, such as genre, cast, director, and other relevant content information.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the similarity of features (e.g., genre, director, etc.) to movies the user has already shown interest in.
- **Movie Dataset:** Utilizes a dataset that includes movie information like title, genre, director, and other features.
- **Recommendations:** Provides a list of movie recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- TMDB Database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
   ```

2. Load the dataset:
   ```python
   movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')  # Example dataset
   ```

3. Fit the content-based filtering model:
   ```python
   tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
   tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(movies['description'])
   ```

4. Compute the cosine similarity matrix:
   ```python
   cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
   ```

5. Get movie recommendations:
   ```python
   def get_recommendations(title):
       idx = movies.index[movies['title'] == title].tolist()[0]
       sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))
       sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
       sim_scores = sim_scores[1:11]  # Get top 10 recommendations
       movie_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]
       return movies['title'].iloc[movie_indices]
   ```

6. Test the recommender system:
   ```python
   recommended_movies = get_recommendations('The Matrix')
   print(recommended_movies)
   ```
